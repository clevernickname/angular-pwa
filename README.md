# Angular PWA Overview

### Build a Progressive Web App with Angular

This repository contains the final version of the code for the tutorial that shows how to build an Angular application, walks through the steps to make it a Progressive Web Application (PWA) and then deploys it using Netlify to use the application on a mobile device.

**Angular Application**
The app uses the NewsAPI to let users view Technology and JavaScript news headlines.

**Progressive Web Application**
Uses the Angular CLI to make the Angular app a working PWA.

**Deploy with Netlify**
Uses the Netlify cloud hosting service to deploy the PWA from a git repository so it can be added to and used on a mobile device.
